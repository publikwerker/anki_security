# anki_security

Two days into my Python education, and things are going well.
I'm able to use what I know of ES6 and extrapolate it to Python.
The learning curve doesn't seem as sharp.
This time, though, I am teaching myself, so it feels like more "work" to learn it.
I'm able to watch tutorials and apply little bits to my programs.
Learning Python is definitely easier than learning JavaScript.
My learning style of reading and implementing seems to be working: I'm building a solid knowledge base, but I'm stuck on the implementation.
I spent the first day doing exercises and reading the basics.
The second day was researching the Anki API and doing more basic exercises.
Today, I'll be fleshing out my Anki app. I'm to have a MVP by the end of the day.
Definitely doable.
